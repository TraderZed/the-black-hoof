          %h1 Opened in Early October 2008
          %p Everything is made: from the charcuterie to the cocktail garnishes. Itâ€™s a meat and off-cut centric menu to be sure, but there is often a fish option (sometimes, even a veggie option). There is much attention to detail in the service. The atmosphere is boisterous and casual.
          %h2 Come eat.
